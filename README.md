# WhatsApp Assistant Bot ðŸ¤–

A sophisticated WhatsApp bot powered by Google's Gemini AI that acts as my personal assistant. The bot can handle individual conversations, track group statistics, document group "lore", share files, send stickers, and more!

## About the Project

Managing multiple WhatsApp conversations and staying on top of group dynamics can be overwhelming, especially when juggling academic life, work, and social interactions. This WhatsApp Assistant Bot was created to solve the common problem of missing important messages, losing track of group conversations, and the tedious task of manually sharing files with friends and colleagues. 

The bot serves as an intelligent intermediary that can handle routine tasks like sharing study materials, tracking group activity patterns, and most uniquely - automatically documenting the "lore" or important moments in group chats that often get lost in the constant stream of messages. Whether it's remembering who said what during an important discussion, keeping track of inside jokes, or simply providing quick access to shared resources, this assistant ensures nothing important slips through the cracks while maintaining the casual, friendly vibe that makes WhatsApp conversations enjoyable.
